Automated Car Parking System (ACPS) uses modern technologies such as sensors,
controllers, and automation mechanisms to park vehicles efficiently without human intervention.
By intelligently detecting available parking slots and maneuvering vehicles into them,
this system optimizes parking space usage, enhances safety, and reduces the time 
and effort required from drivers.
